# the health weather app 

The health weather app is a simple application that aims to approximate the prevalence or susceptibility to infectious diseases. Currently, it is only approximating COVID-19 prevalence. 
The prevalence forecast is approximated by combining two estimators. The first one is calculated by the density of isolated genomes per day. The second one is calculated as the percentage of the adenine content inside the SARS-Cov2 genome. 
You can also access a genome comparison panel to address the possible emergence of new variants. In there, you can find the comparison between the current genome and the 15-day and 30-day forecasts. 

The mobile version of the app is also available at Gumroad. (https://octaviogl.gumroad.com/l/mbkvk)

If you're a Linux user, you can also try genome-coder, a simple analysis tool for viral genomes.
